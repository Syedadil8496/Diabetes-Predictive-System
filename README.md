# Diabetes-Predictive-System

i have enclosed an ppt along with this respo which includes all information about the project 

for running the project 
two it can be 
1) by downloading the anaconda navigator and then open the jupyter notebook in that after download
   in jupyter notebook go to upload and upload the ipynb file from respo
   major change in the whole project is that path for data to be taken from csv file
   for my desktop i have an path of df=pd.read_csv(r'E:\intership project\diabetes.csv')
   change here the path by right clicking on csv file and go to properties after  that security below u will find the path

2) we can use this project in vs code also but we have to donwload the all extensions for that
